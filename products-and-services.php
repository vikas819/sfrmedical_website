                                      This report describes the injuries sustained and treatment received by a victim. The report
                                      includes information from the medical notes of all the medical and surgical specialities that
                                      cared for the patient during the patient’s attendance at the hospital. The SFR1 is structured
                                      and devoid of medical jargon. The SFR1 is typically used by the local CPS to aid charging
                                      decisions. Additionally, SFR1 forms s10 evidence if the prosecution and defence agree on the
                                      contents and hence is then admissible in court.<br><br>
                                      For SFR1s, we offer a standard request service (within 10 days) and an urgent request service
                                      (within 24 hours). The urgent request service is extremely useful when a suspect is in custody
                                      and awaiting a charging decision, or when the case is going to court in the next seven days.

                                  after reviewing an SFR1. An SFR2 is s9 evidence and contains subjective conclusions that are
                                  written by experienced doctors. SFR2s, to date, have been required in less than 1% of the
                                  cases we have supplied medical evidence for.

                                  We create 3D reconstructions of injuries from a patient’s CT and/or MRI scan to specifically
                                  answer questions such as the length, depth, site, or severity of an injury. These reports are a
                                  game-changer for victims of violent crime as they illustrate the exact injury in great detail,
                                  instantly portraying the gravitas of an injury to non-medical personnel. The report produced
                                  is s9 evidence, and is thus admissible in court.
