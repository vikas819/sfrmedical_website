                                <p>There are thousands of victims of violent crimes in the UK every year and medical evidence is needed to charge suspects. To date, obtaining medical evidence has been problematic, tedious and cumbersome. These issues lead to delays, miscarriages of justice and more violent crimes, either as retaliatory actions or against new victims.</p>

                                <p>Historically, this process took approximately 2-3 months. But why? We investigated and found that it was likely due to a confluence of factors, including:</p>


                                <ul>
                                    <li>since 2010, there has been a 15% decline in police staffing while overall crimes rates have held steady  </li>
                                    <li>only physicians can translate hospital notes into court-ready medical evidence reports</li>
                                    <li>reports must be written on-site at a hospital, often after long shifts, but writing reports are not part of a physician’s NHS responsibilities</li>
                                    <li>the police must contract with individual doctors and constantly chase them to get the reports</li>
                                    <li>one in eight reports are returned for poor quality because doctors are not trained to write them</li>
                                    <li>given the lag in production, urgent report requests are prohibitive</li>
                                    <li>only 15% of reports are paid for, leading to an unwillingness to write them</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>And because there were so many issues, no one looked for a solution … until now.</p>

                                <p>Dr Johann Grundlingh is an NHS Emergency Medicine and Intensive Care Consultant who has experienced the impact of hospitals not providing medical assault reports in a timely and accurate fashion. He’s worked with multiple police forces on numerous reports but always thought there was a better way to do things. After getting his MBA in 2018, he and classmate Suyash Shrivastava started SFR Medical and piloted different approaches during the first year of business. Through that experience, they realized that addressing the controllable pain points and using a different but well-known reporting template (the SFR) could drastically improve the situation for everyone involved.</p>

                                <p>We know that the police have more important things to do with their time than constantly chase medical reports. We also know that doctors would prefer to see and help patients rather than get bogged down by paperwork. So our solution is two-fold: <br>(1) put a single point of contact into place, our dedicated Client Relationship Managers whose sole job is to manage the workflow, and <br>(2) recruit a team of freelance medical transcribers who can write the reports on their own time, in a place of their choosing while being confident that they will get paid for the work they produce.</p>
                                <p>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to understand how we can help you.</p>
